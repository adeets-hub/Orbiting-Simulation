# Orbiting-Simulation

This Pygame simulation shows how Earth's elliptical orbit changes according to Kepler's First and Second Laws. 

Kepler's First Law:
Planets have an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one of the two foci of the ellipse.

Kepler's Second Law:
Planets sweep out equal amounts of areas of space in equal periods of time. 

The program gives the user the option to change the size of the ellipse, and displays Kepler's First and Second Laws based on those changes. The program also displays what month it is when Kepler's Second Law is initiated, because time plays an important part. 

Buttons:
Size: You can make the ellipse bigger and smaller using the arrows on the screen. 

Kepler's Second Law: This shows the area that the Earth sweeps for each month of its orbit, using different colors. 

Moon: By pressing this button, the Moon appears and it revolves the Earth. 

Pause/Play: These buttons stop and resume the program. 

Disclaimer: You have to have Pygame downloaded in order to run the program.
